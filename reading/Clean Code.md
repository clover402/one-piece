# Chap 1
>*I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The
logic should be straightforward(简单的、率直的) to make it hard
for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to
ease maintenance, error handling complete
according to an articulated(明确表达的) strategy, and performance close to optimal(最优的) so as not to tempt(引诱，鼓动)
people to make the code messy(凌乱的) with unprincipled(不道德的) optimizations(最优选择). Clean code does one thing
well.*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             --Bjarne Stroustrup(Author of C++)  

>*Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code
reads like well-written prose(散文). Clean code never
obscures(使隐晦，使费解) the designer’s intent but rather is full
of crisp abstractions(抽象) and straightforward lines
of control.* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     --Grady Booch
